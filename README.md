# A Crowdfunding Lottery application on Ethereum Blockchain

The goal of this thesis is built a Crowdfunding Lottery application completely
decentralized on the Ethereum network.
With this Dapp people can create different lottery campaigns and also
contribute to a specific campaign with some amount of money. When the
lottery campaign ends up a random contributor will receive half of the money
raised while the other money is used for a noble cause by the administrator
of the campaign.
This application has been developed by using the Ethereum test blockchain
to offer people a fair chance to win a lottery but also to help for something
good increasing the human welfare and improving the human society.
Itâ€™s possible to create a crowdfunding lottery campaign used to donate
part of the raised money to a charity, to an environmental cleaning company
or to improve education in undeveloped countries.

Every person should change the world for the better and by using the
practical application implemented and discussed in this thesis all have the
possibility to do it.


## The frontend VS the Backend

- Frontend based on a ReactJS application which interact with web3 to talk with the Ethereum Blockchain
- Backend based on a truffle project which help on compiling/deploying smart contracts. 
Contract are deployed with ganache cli (local test blockchain) before using the test network of Ethereum


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your computer.
- ganache cli
- Metamask browser extension

cd appui
```

4. Install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

### Usage
